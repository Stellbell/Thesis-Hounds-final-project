# Final Project Proposal / Wireframe

Due date: Week 10, April 20th 2023

Project objective: Design and build your own website.

By
Stella Schubert

Topic and rationale
Design a start up website for a newly founded tutoring company called "Thesis hounds". The boutique company specialises in tutoring and supporting Phd students in all aspects and stages of their Phd thesis.

The layout of the homepage will include a header with navigation links; About, Services, Contact. Two navs will have a dropdown menu.

The main section will begin with a heading and a paragraph introducing the services. Next will be a layout of 6 images, with each image having a heading which relates to a Phd tutoring service. The image will be a button that once clicked will open a pop up box of further information specific to the heading.
On the corner of each image will be a small button "Book now" which will take the user to another page for booking information.

At the bottom section of the main will be two boxes with the heading " Specials", once clicked, will open an info box on promotional specials.

There will be a footer at the bottom of the page mainly for design purposes.

* Additional to the basic layout there is an ambitious design feature I would like to propose: In the top left corner I would like a Melbourne weather widget which will show an animation of a dog that will be responsive to the variations of weather. For example if it is raining the dog will hold an umbrella and say " Great day to be inside writing your thesis".
